# About

I am a PhD candidate at California Institute of Technology advised by Matilde Marcolli. My mathematical interests are at the intersection of differential geometry, operator algebras and stochastic calculus, focused on applications to classical and quantum open systems and information theory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and systems biology. Currently I work on quantum stochastic processes in noncommutative geometry, and also consider applications of operator stochastic processes and random matrix processes to systems biology

In another life I worked in computational epigenetics. I did graduate work in pseudorandomness and computational complexity. Before that I studied electrical engineering, mathematics and physics. I have experience working with scala, rust, python and unix shell scripting among others, with HPC environment, docker and singularity containers, and in working with bulk and single cell next generation sequencing data.
